**Abstract**: Task-oriented dialogue systems such as Alexa and Siri are often trained on a corpus of data to handle a restricted set of within-domain prompts. However, users engaging with these system can produce out-of-distribution (OOD) prompts. Current methods for OOD detection rely on fine-tuning pretrained models on labeled data. More recent research demonstrates that adaptive representation learning and density estimation — coined REDE — has great potential to discriminate OOD from ID. Our contribution is a better understanding of the as- sumptions built into REDE approach. We outperform the author’s approach by performing a comprehensive study of embedding representa- tions and density estimators.

**Abstract**: The use of machine learning on satellite imagery has the potential to address and anticipate adverse climate events by estimating climate impacts of urbanization, especially in quickly developing regions of the world. We demonstrate that satellite imagery in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia can support prediction of vehicle, asphalt, and building density. We seek to understand the impact of climate as measured through the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect by examining the relationship between predictions and LandSat Temperature data (LST).

**Abstract**: We seek to help with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in images submitted on a mobile platform (CottonAce) in applications for pest management. Previous work in OOD detection for pest management are limited because the scope of OOD is too wide and the models built are too large to load onto a mobile device at inference time. \textbf{Our goal is to explore contrastive learning, namely contrasting shifted instances (CSI), as an potential technique for OOD detection.} We focus our work on better understanding the hyperparameter space of CSI to discern how it can produce effective latent representations for the downstream task of OOD detection in a self-supervised manner.

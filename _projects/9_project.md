**Abstract**: COVID-19 has accelerated the rise of e-commerce and home delivery, and automated parcel lockers are an avenue to improve delivery efficiency. Amazon Hub Lockers are secure, self-service kiosks that allow consumers to pick up their packages on their own time. While Amazon Hub lockers are strategically located, little research has been done on the accessibility and equity impacts. With data from the American Community Survey and Google Maps API, I model the count of Amazon Hub lockers and the presence of Amazon Hub lockers in Boston, MA following a regression framework. Given the wide consumer reach of Amazon and efforts to rebuff its public image from findings of racial bias in Same Day Delivery in 2016 [1], my null hypothesis is that Amazonâ€™s placement of Hub lockers throughout the city of Boston do not exhibit racial bias.

> Freeing yourself was one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another.
â€”Toni Morrison

***

I am excited to say that I finished my coursework for my Master of Science in Data Science at Harvard University's Institute for Applied Computational Sciences! :tada: From Head Start (a US HHS early education program for low-income children) and portable classrooms in underfunded and overcrowded public school districts to the bucolic bubble of Williams and the ivory fortress of Harvard, it's been a wild journey. It has been rewarding, but exhausting. 

As the first in my family to graduate from college, I am honored to be the first to attend graduate school.  Graduating from Williams and stepping into the working world with a badge of privilege and access together was an act of freeing myself from socioeconomic adversity. Attending Harvard and navigating life after was and continues to be an act of trying to claim ownership of that freed self. For now, this looks like emails from Sallie Mae, but in time I am hoping to manifest a more freed self. 

Below are some highlights of my time along three axes: academic, extracurricular, personal. 

### Academic

A snapshot of a few of my favorite courses:

* Machine Learning for Sustainable Systems at MIT
* Bayesian Inference & Applications
* Data Science II
* Survey of Probabilistic Machine Learning
* Grand Challenges in Technology at Harvard Kennedy School 

### Extracurricular 

* I was co-chair of the Graduate Advisory Committee (GAC) of Harvard IACS
* I was a research assistant at Harvard Business School (HBS)
* I mentored two G1 students in my G2 year
* I attended the Harvard Data Science Initiative (HDSI) conference in Fall 2022
* I was part of the inaugural cohort of Diversity, Inclusion, and Leadership (DIL) Fellows that helped launch student-led orientation programming and a space for critical pedagogy in data science curriclum

### Personal 
* I took two ceramics classes!
* I attended a relief-making workshop 
* I gave my parents a full tour of Harvard and New England

Onwards!

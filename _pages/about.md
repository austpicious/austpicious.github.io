Hello! My name is Austin. I'm a technologist with an eye towards social justice and design based in Oakland. I like to think about technology, social impact, and design/art. 

Most recently, I studied data science & machine learning at <a href='https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/'>Harvard IACS</a> (M.S. '23). Before that, I was a Fellow @ <a href='https://www.dssgfellowship.org/'>Data Science for Social Good</a> & <a href='https://www.turing.ac.uk/'>Alan Turing Institute</a>, focused on applying data science to help connect unsheltered folks to services. I also worked on Machine Learning + Applied Science + Data Science problems @ <a href='https://tripadvisor.com'>Tripadvisor</a>, focused on paid marketing for travel, and @ <a href='https://nianticlabs.com/'>Niantic</a>, focused on geospatial data and launching new mobile games for <a href='https://nianticlabs.com/news/nianticrealworldplatform?hl=en'>real-world social interaction</a>.

In my free time, I dabble in cooking, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/aust.nguyen.ceramics/'>ceramics</a>, and learning the art of being present.
